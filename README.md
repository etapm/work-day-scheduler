# work-day-scheduler

## Description
The primary motivation for creating a functional Javascript element that compliments the starter code of the schedule was to test my knowledge and skills. The resulting project, a daily schedule organizer, serves to aid in the organization of daily tasks and responsibilities. Through the process of building this project, I gained experience utilizing APIs to enhance the authenticity of the application and improve its functionality.

## Installation
Review the code on the GitHub repository. The deployed site can be accessed at [GitHub Pages](https://etapm.github.io/work-day-scheduler/) or by visiting the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/etapm/work-day-scheduler).
## Usage
The home page of the work day scheduler displays the current time and date. Users are provided with the ability to input their schedule, starting at any hour of the day. The schedule can be easily edited or deleted as needed and a refresh of the page will confirm if the data has been saved. To assist with time management, the schedule is color-coded with the past being represented by gray, the present being represented by red, and the future being represented by green.

###### Step 1: See day and time.
